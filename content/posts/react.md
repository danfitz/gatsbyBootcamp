React is cool!

## Why React is cool

I guess I love abstraction. React elevates front-end work to a point where you can think about your content in more interesting ways. It strips away the extraneous details that could make front-end boring, e.g., having to manually inject a DOM element into the page. Instead, you think of your content *as* content, i.e., `state`. React handles the procedural, step-by-step DOM manipulation for you.
