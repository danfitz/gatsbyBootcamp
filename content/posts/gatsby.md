This is a blog!

## Why I'm building it

I love static site generators for their ability to abstract data away from HTML files and then inject that data at build time. I also love that static site generators tend to be minimalist by design.

I came from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Now that I'm training myself in JavaScript, it's natural for me to grab the best static site generator in JS land: Gatsby!
